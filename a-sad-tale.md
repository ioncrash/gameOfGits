House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned stark does something dreamy because this writer has never seen GoT.
This is the dream-story branch after all.
I have a faint idea what branch means.

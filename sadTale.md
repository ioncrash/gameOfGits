House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned stark grows a set of laser arms and threatens the shit out of House
Lannister. Well, except Tyrion -- he's pretty cool. After that, the White
Walkers try to come down, but Ned uses his laser arms to destroy them.
